# Guide to Coop
I've helped a lot of people with advice about coop, and a lot of the time the advice is the same. Here's that advice distilled. If you want to talk to me personally, email me at grafetu@gmail.com and I'll try to help. A friend of mine co-wrote [this guide](https://evykassirer.github.io/playing-the-internship-game/) which is way more comprehensive, so I recommend you check that out as well.

### Whos is this guide for?
People who are hungry for more success in the UWaterloo co-op system, specifically people looking for Software jobs. If you're trying to get a job during COVID this guide may not be useful, I hear the job market is terrible and that's all I know. However if you already get good jobs or are ahead of your peers, this advice may not be helpful.

### Why is my advice worth anything?
Skip this section if you don't care.

I was a fuckup, but "made it" anyways. My first coop I got through nepotism (my friend's dad was CTO of the company), it was a shitshow and two months in me and the other coop stopped doing work. A fulltime got his high-school kid to do our job for two weeks and they did more in those two weeks than we did in a month. I didn't learn anything. Second coop was worse: back in the day you couldn't no-rank an offer, if you got matched with a job you were forced to take it. So I ended up doing manual QA, tapping buttons on android phones, filling in spreadsheets when something breaks, and trying not to think about my failures. I'm not a huge brain genius that got Google first term or something. I was a lazy waste, and I started with two QA jobs. 

But then I started taking coop seriously, tried a bunch of things (which I will list), and I ended up getting two successively better Toronto dev jobs. Then I made it to Cali: a Stripe internship, then a Facebook internship (I'm at Stripe full time now).

This is only my experience, but I've been told "thanks for the help" and "that's good advice" enough times that I think this'll be helpful to a lot of people.


## The most important details:

### WaterlooWorks

Apply to fifty companies every time. Until you're consistently getting interviews with all the companies you want, max out your applications every time. Go to every interview, and use them as an opportunity to practice. If you don't care about the job, then there's no pressure to perform.

### Side projects

In first and second year, side projects are king. Some companies care about grades (Google, Wish, others probably), but side projects will get you that Southern Ontario dev job that'll kickstart your career. You can start big, but you can also start with a small discord bot, or making a personal website. My best strategy for side projects was joining hackathons with a friend or two I trust, and then trying really hard to get something that looks good on a resume. It's really easy to code at a hackathon, you don't have to force yourself to do it.

Side projects will get you your first dev jobs, and after that they matter less. But first you have to pass your interviews:
 

### Leetcode
There's a straight conversion between leetcode problems and annual salary: ten leetcode problems is +$2000 a year annual salary. This is an approximation based on my experience, but I want to make it clear that if you do one hundred leetcode problems you're going to have a much easier time with your early career.

If you do a hundred problems, you have a good chance at passing the Facebook internship interviews. For Facebook I walked into the interview, exchanged greetings, and then worked on the problem until the time was up, said thanks, and left. There were never any behavioural questions, never a "why do you want to work at this company", just pure leetcode. A lot of companies are very similar, so it's the **only thing you have to get good at**.

But you have to do leetcode the right way. You get one submission. No IDE's, no test runs. Just type into the leetcode.com in-browser editor, test everything in your head or on a piece of paper. If you don't submit perfectly first try, **you're wrong and you failed the interview**. You _must_ be able to run through all the possible test cases before submitting, and leetcode will force you to get good at this. If your mistake was something silly like you forgot about handling empty inputs _you're wrong_. Maximize your acceptance rate on leetcode, you can see that on your profile.

To be clear: leetcode is really hard! I was so bad at it at first I avoided doing it because it made me feel stupid do fail these basic easy problems. My friends could do the problems just fine and would act as if they were easy, so I stopped doing leetcode because I didn't want to think about how I was so dumb. But eventually I started to get some success, and I started being able to do the problems.

If you have trouble, start with the easy problems, the easiest you can find, and if that's too hard, just keep at it. Maybe peek at the solutions, or try to google a bit for some help. Leetcode is just a skill, like chess or lifting weights, you can just practice and shoot up in skill, even if it feels overwhelming and confusing at the start. You don't need a huge brain, you just need to practice. Keep at it.


### Resumes

Get at least three people to review your resume. Don't just ask one or two people, get multiple. Especially look for people that get decent jobs. Why at least three people? Because each person has their own weird ideas or is going to focus on some specific problem, but when you get a lot of people looking you can get a comprehensive critique that is less biased. Write down everything that people say, don't try to memorize it. Whenever I critique a resume I ask people to write things down otherwise there's no point.

Read the section on resumes from the book Cracking the Coding Interview. In general UWaterloo has a pretty good machine for refining resumes into a good format.

### Interview Practice

But Leetcode isn't enough. Well, it is, but there's still work to be done. 

I think a lot of people have entered those Tatham Centre interview rooms, had an agonizing wait in the chairs, entered the interview room, and then fallen apart through nerves. I used to run my hands under the cold water in the bathrooms so my hands wouldn't be sweaty during the handshake, and I'd fail problems that were easy just because I was super nervous. I was too busy thinking about how I was doing or why I couldn't focus to focus on the problem.

Well, this is also solvable through practice: [pramp.com](https://www.pramp.com/). 

How it works is this: you schedule an interview, join the google hangouts, answer a problem for thirty minutes, get feedback, and then do the same for your partner. You'll learn quickly to narrate everything you think out loud, to show your problem solving process, and most critically you'll get a lot less nerves during interviews. Before pramp interviews I would get the exact same nerves as real interviews, but after the fifth interview I felt nothing. Interviews were a breeze after that.

### Failure
Most likely you didn't get that sick dev job, and are doing QA, or IT, or something else that's not dev. That's fine, that's how I started, and that's how thousands of other students before you have started. But remember every shitty day at work and work to make sure that never happens again. Uninstall your video games, stop talking to friends that invite you to play league, block reddit and twitch, uninstall windows and switch to linux, whatever it takes to get you side projecting or leetcoding. 

It's probably mentally unhealthy to obsess, but success tastes sweet and I fueled my side projects with anxiety about my career and failure. I would see my future stretching out in front of me, constantly doing shit jobs and shit companies, watching all my friends be successful and happy, and that would motivate me. Should you do this? I feel like ethically I can't recommend it, some people reading this might already be super obsessive and neurotic, and this validation they should obsess more will destroy them. I don't want to have someone wracked with anxiety to get even more anxiety after reading this. At the same time when I see people say "don't worry too much" and "you'll get the good coops eventually" I get angry because I hard disagree with that. There is a correct amount of worrying and anxiety, too little is bad, just the same as too much.

I intentionally feed my anxiety, eventually getting nightmares about work, but it worked out for me and it increased my output. I'm mentally healthy and happy, and getting my career started was the first bit of confidence I needed to build the rest of myself up. Coop is great because if you fail you have time to prepare for your next shot, and you get six chances.

### The offer
If you do get an offer: Negotiate. They will _never_ take away your offer because you tried to negotiate. Always ask for a few dollars more, especially if you have a competing offer. Just ask nicely, "Hey, could you increase the salary from 20 to 24 an hour? I would feel a lot more confident about my decision if you could do that for me" or "I have an offer from AutoSoft, and while I would love to work with you, I couldn't justify it if I could get more there". If they say something like "HR won't let me" that's a lie, but you probably don't have enough leverage to negotiate anyway. I used to negotiate for jobs (and return offers) I knew I wasn't going to take just to practice or get better leverage. This advice is more important for fulltime, but it's good to get into the habit now.

It can feel super scary to ask for more, especially if you feel lucky to even get the offer. I still get too scared, but in retrospect it's always worth it. More [info for fulltime here](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/).

### On the job
Nice, you got a job! Dedicate yourself to this coop, ask as many questions as you can, and leech knowledge from your coworkers. Ask for projects you think are too hard for you, and then ask for help. Looking stupid doesn't matter if the first three months. There's this type of person that asks a lot of basic questions for months and before you know it, they know everything and you're coming to them for help. It's good to be this type of person.

But also: now is the time to start worrying about your next job. You want to make your resume real nice for your next internship, and the easiest way to do that is to start planning now. Look for projects that have _measureable_ impact and look good. Aim for projects or tasks that lend themselves to interview lines, something that'll get you a "23% faster" or "2x increase in" in your job bullet points. Move the needle on some quantifiable metrics.
