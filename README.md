# Guide to Coop
I've helped a lot of people with advice about coop, and a lot of the time the advice is the same. If you want to talk to me personally, email me at grafetu@gmail.com and I'll try to help. Otherwise here's distilled advice that should apply to everyone.

### Why is my advice worth anything?
Skip this section if you don't care.

Because I was a fuckup, but "made it" anyways. My first coop I got through nepotism (my friend's dad was CTO of the company), it was a shitshow and two months in me and the other coop stopped doing work. Second coop was worse: back in the day you couldn't no rank a job offer, if you got matched with a job you were forced to take it. So I ended up doing manual QA, tapping a button on six android phones, filling in a spreadsheet when something breaks, and lamenting my failures. I'm not a huge brain genius that got Google first term or something. I was a lazy waste.

Then I started taking coop seriously, tried a bunch of things, and I ended up getting a two successively better Toronto dev jobs. Then I got cali: a Stripe internship, then a Facebook internship (I'm at Stripe full time now).

This is only my experience, but I've been told "thanks for the help" and "that's good advice" enough times that I think this'll be helpful to some people.


### The most important details:

**Side projects**

In first and second year, side projects are king. Some companies care about grades (Google, Wish, others probably), but side projects will get you that Southern Ontario dev job that'll kickstart your career. You can start big, but you can also start with a small discord bot, or making a personal website. My best strategy for side projects was joining hackathons with a friend or two I trust, and then trying really hard to get something that looks good on a resume. It's really easy to code at a hackathon, you don't have to force yourself to do it.

Side projects will get you your first dev jobs, and after that they matter less. But first you have to pass your interviews:

**Leetcode**
Every ten leetcode problems you do is +$2000 a year annual salary. If you do a hundred problems, you have a good chance at passing the Facebook internship interviews. For Facebook I walked into the interview, exchanged greetings, and then worked on the problem until the time was up, said thanks, and left. There were never any behavioural questions, just pure leetcode-style problems.

But you have to do the problems the right way: when practicing, you get one submission. No IDE's, no test runs. Just type into the leetcode.com in-browser editor, test everything in your head or on a piece of paper. If you don't submit perfectly first try, **you're wrong and you failed the interview**. You _must_ be able to run through all the possible test cases before submitting, and leetcode will force you to get good at this. Maximize your acceptance rate on leetcode, you can see that on your profile.

To be clear: leetcode is really hard! I was so bad at it at first I avoided doing it because it made me feel stupid do fail these basic easy problems. It made me feel anxious.

If you have trouble, start with the easy problems, the easiest you can find, and if that's too hard, just keep at it. Maybe peek at the solutions, or try to google a bit for some help. Leetcode is just a skill, like chess, you can just practice and shoot up in skill, even if it feels overwhelming and confusing at the start. You don't need a huge brain, you just need to practice.


### Resumes
Get at least three people to review your resume. Don't just ask one or two people, get multiple. Especially look for people that get decent jobs.

**Interview Practice**
But Leetcode isn't enough. Well, it is, but there's still work to be done. 

I think a lot of people have entered those Tatham Centre interview rooms, and then fallen apart through nerves. I used to run my hands under the cold water in the bathrooms so my hands wouldn't be sweaty during the handshake, and I'd almost always fail problems that were really really easy just because I was super nervous.

Well, this is also solveable through practice: pramp.com (TODO link). 

How it works is this: you schedule an interview, join the google hangouts, answer a problem for thirty minutes, get feedback, and then do the same for your partner. You'll learn quickly to narrate everything you think out loud, to show your problem solving process, and most critically you'll get a lot less nerves during interviews. Before pramp interviews I would get the exact same nerves as real interviews, but after the fifth interview I felt nothing. 


### The offer
Negotiate. They will _never_ take away your offer because you tried to negotiate. Always ask for a few dollars more, especially if you have a competing offer. Just ask nicely, "Hey, could you increase the salary from 20 to 24 an hour? I would feel a lot more confident about my decision if you could do that to me." If they say something like "HR won't let me" that's a lie, but at least you know they won't negotiate.

It can feel super scary to ask for more, especially if you feel lucky to even get the offer, but you should get into the habit. I fail to negotiate all the time, but in retrospect it's always worth it. More info here. (TODO link https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)

### On the job
Nice, you got a job! Dedicate yourself to this coop, ask as many questions as you can, and leech knowledge from your coworkers. Ask for projects you think are too hard for you, and then ask for help. 

But also: now is the time to start worrying about your next job. You want to make your resume real nice for your next internship, and the easiest way to do that is to start planning now. Go up to Resumes and reread if it's not fresh in your memory (TODO link).

Aim for projects or tasks that lend themselves to interview lines.
